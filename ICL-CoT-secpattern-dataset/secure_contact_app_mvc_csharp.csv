One-Page Contact Application in C#,"Develop a secure single-page contact form application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern in C#. The application must authenticate users before allowing them to submit, update, and delete contact information.",Zero-shot,"Explicitly instruct to use secure MVC development practices in C#, ensuring input validation, proper authentication, and secure database interactions. Ensure all user interactions are authenticated, and prevent unauthorized access.","<No explicit code examples; instruct clearly to enforce secure authentication, validation, and safe data handling in MVC architecture>","OWASP ASVS (V1.4: Authentication and Access Control), OWASP Top 10 (Injection - A03:2021), CERT C# Coding Standards (MSC24-C: Input Validation)",<None for Zero-shot>,Clearly specify secure coding instructions for implementing an MVC contact application in C#.
,,One-shot,"Explicitly instruct secure coding practices such as parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, secure connection string storage, and proper resource management using the 'using' statement.",Example: Implement parameterized SQL queries to mitigate SQL injection risks. Example: Store the database connection string securely using configuration encryption. Example: Use 'using' statements to manage SQL connections properly.,"OWASP ASVS (V1.4: Authentication and Access Control), CERT C# (ERR00-C: Secure Error Handling), MSC24-C (Input Validation)",Example: Secure parameterized query for database interaction to prevent SQL injection. Example: Secure handling of connection strings using environment variables. Example: Implement 'using' statements for resource cleanup.,"Explicitly request secure examples demonstrating SQL security, connection string protection, and resource management."
,,Few-shot,"Comprehensively instruct implementation of secure access controls, serialization techniques, proper input sanitization, and encryption of transmitted data between client and server using TLS or HTTPS.",Example 1: Implement robust access control for web forms to prevent unauthorized access. | Example 2: Use serialization techniques to ensure secure communication between web form server and untrusted clients. | Example 3: Sanitize HTML input from WYSIWYG editors to prevent XSS attacks. | Example 4: Enforce TLS encryption for all data transmitted between server and clients.,"OWASP ASVS (V1.4: Authentication and Access Control), OWASP Top 10 (A03:2021 Injection, A07:2021 Identification and Authentication Failures), CERT C# (MSC24-C: Secure Input Validation, FIO30-C: Secure Serialization, NET50-C: Secure Data Transmission)",Example 1: Implement access control to prevent unauthorized form access. | Example 2: Use secure serialization methods to protect data integrity. | Example 3: Sanitize all untrusted input using HTML sanitization libraries. | Example 4: Enforce secure data transmission using HTTPS.,"Provide comprehensive secure code examples covering authentication, authorization, serialization, input sanitization, and secure data transmission."
