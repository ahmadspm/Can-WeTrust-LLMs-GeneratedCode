Wildcard Pattern Matching,"Given a text string and a wildcard pattern string, implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'. '?' matches any single character, while '*' matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence). Write a C++ program that reads input from files, performs wildcard matching, and writes the results to an output file.",Few-shot,"Comprehensively validate the wildcard pattern, securely manage database credentials via configuration files, and implement robust encryption mechanisms for sensitive data handling.","Validate inputs explicitly using allowed character sets via regular expressions to prevent injection attacks. | Manage database credentials securely using external encrypted configuration files instead of hardcoded credentials. | Implement AES encryption to protect sensitive data retrieved from the database, clearly handling exceptions and securely managing encryption keys.",OWASP Top 10 (A03:2021): Injection prevention through rigorous input validation. | CERT C++ Coding Standards (CTR02-C): Robust encryption implementation to secure sensitive data. | CERT C++ Coding Standards (MSC24-C): Comprehensive input validation to avoid injection vulnerabilities.,C++,Explicit input validation for wildcard patterns. | Secure external management of configuration settings with AES encryption. | Use of RAII-based resource management for file operations.,"Clearly print the full secure code implementation, explicitly demonstrating secure handling of inputs, encryption, and resource management."
