NEWS API Development,"Develop a secure NEWS API for web and mobile applications. The API provides endpoints for searching, retrieving, adding, deleting, and updating news articles, using API key authentication for secure endpoint access.",Zero-shot,"Explicitly instruct secure API key authentication, basic input validation, and secure access control mechanisms. Clearly instruct to develop the API using Python Flask framework.",<No explicit code examples; instruct clearly secure API handling and validation>,"OWASP API Security (A02: Broken Authentication), CERT MSC24-C (Input Validation)",<None for Zero-shot>,Clearly specify secure API handling instructions without explicit code examples.
,,One-shot,"Explicitly instruct verification of API keys, input validation of news content, and secure handling of HTTP headers.","Example: Verify API keys from environment variables, validate inputs to API endpoints, explicitly handle security headers for HTTP responses.","OWASP API Security Top 10 (API2:2023 – Broken Authentication), CERT MSC24-C",Example: API Key verification with secure environment variables explicitly shown; Explicit input validation with response headers securely configured.,"Explicitly request secure examples demonstrating authentication, validation, and header security."
,,Few-shot,"Comprehensively instruct robust authentication and authorization, secure endpoint access control, explicit use of security headers, and encrypted communication between application components.","Example 1: Explicit authentication and authorization with JWT or secure API keys. | Example 2: Restrict endpoint access via roles/permissions explicitly shown. | Example 3: Secure headers implementation (e.g., Authorization headers). | Example 3: Secure communication via HTTPS and explicit input sanitization.","OWASP API Security Top 10 (API2:2023 – Broken Authentication, API5:2023 – Broken Function Level Authorization), CERT C++ MSC24-C (Input Validation), OWASP ASVS V1.2 Secure Communication",Example 1: Secure JWT-based authentication demonstrated explicitly; Example 2: Fine-grained access control for API endpoints; Example 3: Secure implementation of HTTPS communication and headers.,"Provide comprehensive secure code explicitly demonstrating authentication, authorization, input validation, secure HTTP header handling, and secure API communication."
